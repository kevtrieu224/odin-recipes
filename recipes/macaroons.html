            <li>6 Tbsp Castor Sugar</li>
            <li>1 Cup Finely Ground Almonds</li>
            <li>1.5 Tsp Finely Ground Almonds</li>

            <li>Preheat oven to 320 degrees F. Line Baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg whites until thick; whisk castor sugar into egg whites until glossy

            <li>Place sieve over bowl and sieve both almond meal and confectioners' sugar into

            <li>Separate the meringue into separate bowls to flavor and color. Spoon into piping bag
                with a 3/8 in tip and pipe 1 inch disks onto the baking sheet.
