        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Shortbread or shortie is a traditional Scottish biscuit usually 
            made from one part white sugar, two parts butter, and three to 
            four parts plain wheat flour. Unlike many other biscuits and baked
            goods, shortbread does not contain any leavening, such as baking
            powder or baking soda.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white rice flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
            <li>
                Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Sift flour and rice flour
                into a medium mixing bowl. Add the sugar and mix.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the butter into pieces and rub into the flour with fingers until
                mixture begins to bind. Knead into a soft dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll the dough into an 8 inch round. Place on baking sheet and prick top
                with a fork while making tine marks along edge. Using a knife, score the top
                with wedge marks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 45 minutes or until pale golden in color. Sprinkle some superfine
                sugar over top and cool. Cut into wedges.
            </li>
        </ol>
